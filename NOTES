First of all, thank you very much for getting back to me with feedback, I am very thankfull for that! 
I am always looking to improve as a developer!

Instalation instructions
    -edit the variables $config['baseurl'] in aplication/config/config.php
    -edit $db['default'] in aplication/config/database.php
    -run via CLI: '$ php index.php setup setup'
    -or use the browser and go to: baseurl/Setup/setup

Things I did differently this time
    -used CodeIgniter framework
    -focused on security
        -read up on best practices for security in CodeIgniter
        -used built-in query builder class which escapes queries
        -used csrf protection on forms
        -escaped output for XSS
    
Things I would change in production
    -download all foreign css/js and use those if connection to cdns cant be established
    -disable migrations
    -use env variables to store credentials
    -make setup class cli accessible only
    -disable php error reporting
    -rewrite urls with .htaccess
    -move app files outside of webroot and keep only assets and index.php there
